# Databricks Genie

Create and query Databricks Genie Spaces for natural language SQL exploration.

## Overview

This skill teaches how to build Genie Spaces that let users ask natural language questions against structured data in Unity Catalog and receive SQL-generated answers. It activates when creating new Genie Spaces, adding sample questions, or programmatically querying a space via the Conversation API. Genie Spaces bridge the gap between business users and complex SQL, enabling self-service analytics through conversation.

## Key Topics

- Creating Genie Spaces with `create_or_update_genie`
- Table schema inspection workflow before space creation
- Sample question design referencing actual column names
- Conversation API for programmatic querying (`ask_genie`, `ask_genie_followup`)
- Follow-up questions with conversation context
- Auto-detection and selection of SQL warehouses
- Table selection guidance (silver/gold layers recommended)
- Space curation with instructions and certified queries
- Choosing between `ask_genie` and direct SQL (`execute_sql`)

## When to Use

- You are creating a new Genie Space for data exploration
- You need to connect Unity Catalog tables to a conversational interface
- You want to ask questions to an existing Genie Space programmatically
- You are testing a newly created Genie Space with sample queries
- You need to add or refine sample questions to improve query generation
- A user explicitly says "ask Genie" or "use my Genie Space"
