# Databricks Vector Search

Patterns for Databricks Vector Search: create endpoints and indexes, query with filters, manage embeddings.

## Overview

This skill covers creating, managing, and querying vector search indexes for RAG and semantic search applications on Databricks. It activates when building retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, implementing similarity matching, or choosing between endpoint and index types. The skill details both standard and storage-optimized endpoints, all three index types (Delta Sync managed, Delta Sync self-managed, Direct Access), and filtering, hybrid search, and CLI operations.

## Key Topics

- Standard vs. Storage-Optimized endpoints (latency, capacity, cost trade-offs)
- Delta Sync indexes with managed embeddings (easiest setup)
- Delta Sync indexes with self-managed (pre-computed) embeddings
- Direct Access indexes for real-time CRUD operations
- Querying with `query_text`, `query_vector`, and hybrid search
- Filtering: dictionary-style (`filters_json`) and SQL-like (`filter_string`)
- Built-in Databricks embedding models (`databricks-gte-large-en`, `databricks-bge-large-en`)
- Triggered vs. continuous pipeline sync
- Index scanning and manual sync operations
- Databricks CLI quick reference for endpoint and index management

## When to Use

- You are building a RAG application and need a vector index
- You need to choose between Standard and Storage-Optimized endpoints
- You are creating a Delta Sync or Direct Access index from a Delta table
- You need to query a vector index with text, vectors, or hybrid search
- You want to apply metadata filters to narrow search results
- You are integrating Vector Search as a retriever tool in an agent
